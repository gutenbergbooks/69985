<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor of presenting for publication the
accompanying paper on the history, distribution, and uses of Ilex
cassine, commonly called youpon, a shrub belonging to the southern and
southeastern parts of the United States. Dr. E. M. Hale, the author,
has made a thorough examination of the scattered information which is
to be found on the subject.</p>

<p>In my opinion it is well to publish this paper, in order to perpetuate
in a concise form the recorded facts concerning the economic and
ceremonial uses of this plant among the North American Indians. The
leaves are now used to a limited extent among the Southern people, and
possibly their use may be somewhat extended.</p>

<p>It seems that the detection of caffeine in the leaves of this Ilex
rests upon the chemical analysis of Professor Venable, of the
University of North Carolina. I am not aware that any analysis has been
made by others.</p>

</div>


<p>Several years ago, when reading that delightful narrative, by the
younger Bartram, relating to his travels in Florida, I was much
interested in his mention of the Ilex cassine, and the decoction
made from it, called the “black drink,” in use among the Creeks and
other aborigines of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. My curiosity led
me to investigate the subject, and I was surprised to find so little
written about it. I have consulted all the works in which there are any
allusions to the Ilex cassine, and the results of this research are
embodied in this bulletin.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge the kind assistance and encouragement of many
eminent men; among whom are Dr. George Vasey, Dr. A. W. Chapman, Albert
S. Gatschet, Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, Horatio Hale, and Prof. F. P.
Venable.</p>

<p>I hope this imperfect paper may stimulate others to further
investigations of this indigenous analogue of tea and coffee.</p>

<p>There is a shrub or small tree, a species of holly (Ilex cassine),
growing in the Southern States along the seacoast, not extending inland
more than 20 or 30 miles, from Virginia to the Rio Grande. Its leaves
and tender branches were once used by the aboriginal tribes of the
United States in the same manner as the Chinese use tea and the South
Americans use maté. But while the use of <i>Thea sinensis</i> and
<i>Ilex paraguayensis</i> still survives, the use of the shrub above
mentioned has been almost abandoned by our native Indians and by the
white people who once partially adopted it as a beverage.</p>

<p>The reason for its disuse is hard to discover, for, in common with the
tea and maté, it contains caffeine, or a similar alkaloid. The object
of this paper is to examine its history, to suggest its restoration to
a place among the stimulant beverages, and inquire into its possible
economic value.</p>

<p>I have been able to trace its use as a beverage back to the legendary
migration of the Creeks from their supposed far western home to the
seacoast of the Carolinas. Whether it was used by the prehistoric
mound-builders is a question which may not at present be solved.
But some archæologist of the future may find in the remains of the
mound-builders or their predecessors proof of its use among them.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<h3>BOTANY OF CASSINE.</h3>

<p>Before tracing the history of the cassine from the earliest historic
period down to the present, a few botanical notes relating to the genus
Ilex are appropriate. According to Bentham and Hooker in their “Genera
Plantarum,” this genus contains about 145 species, mostly natives of
Central and South America, but some belonging to the southern portions
of North America; others to the central and tropical parts of the
Eastern Hemisphere; and a few to Africa and Australia.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The question whether any other species than the I. cassine contains
an alkaloid analogous to caffeine has not been investigated. It is
also a question whether any of the allied species, such as those of
the sections <i>Prinoides</i> and <i>Prinos</i>, contain a constituent
which would enable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span> them to be a substitute for the cassine.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Chapman, in his “Botany of the Southern States,” enumerates three
principal species of the genus Ilex, and one variety, namely, <i>Ilex
opaca</i> (common holly), <i>Ilex dahoon</i> (dahoon holly), and
<i>Ilex cassine</i>, sometimes called “Ilex vomitorea.” The one variety
is the <i>Ilex myrtifolia</i> (myrtle-leaved holly). He mentions three
species of the section <i>Prinoides</i> and four of <i>Prinos</i>. The
habitat of all the species, except the I. cassine, extends from the
seacoast inland in swamps, along river courses, and low pine lands. In
fact, no mention is made of their occupying the light sandy soil close
to the seacoast.</p>

<p>Rev. E. C. Reinke writes from Fairfield, Island of Jamaica, that there
are four species of Ilex on the island, viz, <i>I. obcordata</i>, <i>I.
occidentalis</i>, <i>I. diœca</i>, <i>I. montana</i>. Most of these are
found on the Blue Mountains, 5,000 feet above the level of the sea. He
could not ascertain that any use whatever was made of the leaves or
berries either on the island or anywhere in the West Indies. As the
aborigines of the West India Islands are all extinct, or nearly so, it
is not strange that no present use is made of the Ilex. It is probable
that none of these species contains any such active constituents as the
<i>I. cassine</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Chapman, in a recent letter, says: “The I. cassine grows along the
whole east and west coast of Florida, and on the shores of the Gulf
and in Texas, if the <i>Orcophiles</i> (Scheele) is the same, as is
possible.”</p>

<p>John M. Coulter (Contributions U. S. National Herbarium, vol.
<span class="allsmcap">II</span>, No. 1, Texas) mentions that the <i>Ilex cassine</i> yaupon
“extends into Texas to the valley of the Colorado.” This would imply
that it is not found farther westward than the mouth of the Colorado
River, which is at Matagorda Bay, about halfway from the Louisiana line
to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>In a recent pamphlet on the extinct coast Indians of Texas, the
<i>Karankawas</i>, Gatschet mentions their use of the cassine. They
gathered it “in the woods, <i>not</i> on the coast line,” but probably
not beyond the tide water of the rivers. These Indians lived on the
coast from the Colorado River to the Rio Grande, so it must be found as
far as the latter river. Possibly its habitat extends down along the
Mexican coast.</p>

<p>P. M. Hale, in his “Woods of North Carolina,” describes several species
of holly. Of Ilex cassine he writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yopon (<i>I. Cassine</i> Linn.).—An elegant shrub, 10 to 15
feet high, but sometimes rising into a small tree of 20 to
25 feet. Its native place is near to salt water, and it is
found from Virginia southward, but never far in the interior.
Its dark evergreen leaves and bright red berries make it very
ornamental in yards and shrubberies. The leaves are small,
½ to 1 inch long, very smooth, and evenly scalloped on the
edges, with small rounded teeth. In some sections of the
lower district, especially in the region of the Dismal Swamp,
these are annually dried and used for tea, which is, however,
oppressively sudorific—at least, to one not accustomed to
it. The maté, or Paraguay tea, of South America, is of the
same genus as this, but a very different species. Our yopon is
the article from which the famous black drink of the Southern
Indians was made. At a certain time of the year they come
down in droves from a distance of some hundred miles to the
coast for the leaves of this tree. They make a fire on the
ground, and putting a great kettle of water on it, they throw
in a large quantity of these leaves, and, seating themselves
around the fire, from a bowl that holds about a pint they
begin drinking large draughts, which in a short time occasion
them to vomit freely and easily. Thus they continue drinking
and vomiting for the space of 2 or 3 days, until they have
sufficiently cleansed themselves; and then, every one taking a
bundle of the tree, they all retire to their habitations.</p>

<h3>ETYMOLOGY OF THE NAMES “DAHOON,” “CASSINE,” AND “YOUPON.”</h3>

<p>I have been at some pains to ascertain the correct etymology of these
names.</p>

<p>Dr. Albert S. Gatschet, of the Bureau of Ethnology, at Washington, D.
C., one of the best authorities, writes me as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>According to Lawson there are two or three sorts of youpon. The
Indians of South Carolina call it “cassina.” It grows on sand
banks and islands near the sea. (Used by the North Carolina
Indians for tea.) It is written <i>cassena</i>. From Mutter
it would appear that the cassine are chiefly African plants,
nor do I think that the name is Indian. I find no word in
Katawba corresponding to the word “dahoon.” I saw here in the
Botanical Garden a shrub from North Carolina called <i>Ilex
vomitoria</i>, undoubtedly the <i>Assi shrub</i>. “Assi” is
only an abbreviation of <i>Assi lupub’ski</i> (Creek), “small
leaves.” The Shetimasha term was <i>no’ut</i> (Ch. C. Jones).
Tomochichi calls it “foskey,” probably Yamassi, a dialect of
the Creek.</p>
</div>

<p>W. R. Gerard, of New York, an eminent philologist, writes me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The word <i>cassine</i> belongs to the language of the now
extinct Timucua Indians of Florida. Little is known of the
language of those people. It has seemed to me that they
borrowed the word from the Creeks, who call Ilex cassine
<i>ussie</i>, leaf tea. Cassine (c-assi-ne) would seem to be
this word with a guttural prefix and a suffix <i>ne</i> of
unknown meaning. I can not refer the word <i>dahoon</i> to any
Indian language. I believe it to be of French origin, “<i>houx
d’Ahon</i>.” <i>Youpon</i> is Indian, and seems to belong to
the language of the long-extinct Waccoons of North Carolina.
The word is Catawba, for in Catawba <i>yáp</i>, also pronounced
“yop,” means wood, stick, and tree.</p>
</div>

<p>Prof. Lester F. Ward, botanist of the U. S. National Museum, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Linné first used “cassine” as a generic name, and applied it to
a South African plant (Gen. Ed. Nova: No. 371, 1753, and his
Systema Naturæ, ed. 13th, Lipsiæ, 1791). Thomas Walter used
it first as a specific name for Ilex (Flor.-Carolina, Loud.,
1778). None of these two refer to the origin of the word.
Thomas Walter used dahoon as a specific name; Linné copied from
him and spells it “duhoon.”</p>
</div>

<p>Probably Gerard’s explanation of the etymology of those three words
is correct, for at the time Walter and Linné wrote the Indian names
of plants had been carried abroad by botanists and travelers in this
country.</p>


<h3>CHEMISTRY OF CASSINE.</h3>

<p class="center">ANALYSIS OF THE LEAVES OF ILEX CASSINE.</p>

<p>I quote the following from a paper by F. P. Venable, <span class="allsmcap">PH.D.</span>,
University of North Carolina:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Having on hand a small sample of the leaves procured from New
Berue during the winter of 1883, it seemed desirable to make an
examination of them, to decide, if possible, the presence of
any alkaloid or other principle which would make the decoction
useful as a beverage. The usual treatment with magnesium oxide,
exhaustion with water, separation by means of chloroform, and
subsequent purification was adhered to, resulting in obtaining
a small amount of a white substance slightly soluble in water,
more so in alcohol, and easily soluble in chloroform, which
gave distinctly the tests for caffeine, especially the murexide
reaction, and very closely resembled a specimen of pure
caffeine from Powers &amp; Weightman.</p>

<p>This caffeine formed .32 per cent. of the dried leaves. Later
on, in May, a much larger supply of the same leaves was
gotten from the neighborhood of Wilmington. A more thorough
examination of them was then made, with the following results:</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Water in air-dried samples</td>
<td class="tdr">13.19</td>

<td class="tdr">5.75</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Maté or Brazilian holly (<i>Ilex paraguayensis</i>) belongs to
the same genus. Its ash analysis, as made by Señor Arate, is
given in the second column. The plant grows wild in Brazil, and
is very largely used by the South Americans. It has, according
to Peckolt (Pharm. J. Trans. (3) 14, 121-124; Abstract Jour.
Chem. Soc., 1884, 479), been planted, and seems to succeed
well, in the Cape of Good Hope, Spain, and Portugal. It is
stated that six different species of Ilex are used in the
preparation of this tea. Peckolt gives, in his analysis of
the air-dried leaves, the percentage of caffeine as 0.639.
The average percentage of analyses by different authors is
about 1.3. I can find mention of only one other Ilex used as a
substitute for tea. The analysis of this by Ryland and Brown
is quoted in Blythe’s “Composition and Analysis of Foods” (p.
343). It is called the Ilex cassiva, is said to be used as
a tea in Virginia, and the percentage of caffeine is given
as 0.12. This is probably the same thing as the yopon, the
analysis of which is given above, and the “cassiva” may be a
misprint for “cassine.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a more recent paper Professor Venable reports additional analyses,
which are interesting. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some years ago an analysis of the leaves of Ilex cassine
was given in this journal.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In this analysis appeared the
interesting fact that these leaves contained a small percentage
of caffeine. During the winter of 1885-’86, at the request
of some medical friends whose attention was drawn to the
analysis, a more thorough examination was undertaken, not only
of the leaves, but of the berries. It was thought advisable,
at the same time, to examine the leaves and fruit of other
representatives of the Ilex family in this State—<i>Ilex
opaca</i> and <i>Ilex dahoon</i>. This was primarily a search
after alkaloids, and not intended as a complete chemical
examination. As no alkaloids were found other than the caffeine
already mentioned, no account of the work was published, and
the results have been hidden away in my note books ever since.
Thinking, however, that even negative results are often of
some value and that the partial analysis might be of aid to
others, I offer this paper for publication in the journal of
the society.</p>

<p>Besides the <i>I. opaca</i>, <i>I. dahoon</i>, <i>I.
cassine</i>, according to Curtis there are in this State
five additional species of this genus: <i>I. decidua</i>
Walt. <i>I. ambigua</i> Chapman; <i>I. verticillata</i> Gray,
<i>I. glabra</i> Gray, <i>I. coriacea</i> Chapm, but the
examination was not extended to them. In searching for the
alkaloids the directions of Dragendorff were first followed.
The leaves (or crushed berries) were first digested at 40°-50°
with dilute sulphuric acid. This extract was evaporated to
a sirupy consistence, the residue mixed with three or four
times its bulk of alcohol, filtered after 24 hours’ standing,
and washed with alcohol. The alcohol was then distilled off
from the filtrate, the watery residue was diluted with water
and filtered. Petroleum-ether, benzol, and chloroform were
successively used to extract the alkaloidal principles, if any
were present in the acid liquid. Then, after rendering alkaline
with ammonia, the liquid was again extracted with the solvents
mentioned.</p>

<p>As, even with water but slightly acidified with sulphuric acid,
some risk of the destruction or change of the alkaloids was run
during the long evaporation, a second method was made use of,
as follows:</p>

<p>The leaves were digested for 10 hours with 70 per cent alcohol,
the alcohol distilled off, and the residue treated with lead
acetate and soda. The excess of lead was removed by means of
sulphuretted hydrogen and the filtrate from this evaporated
to a thin sirup. This was then treated with strong alcohol,
filtered, and the excess of alcohol distilled off. Bismuth,
potassium-iodide, and sulphuric acid were next used to
precipitate any alkaloid present. The presence of albuminoid
matter rendered it necessary to decompose this by means of
soda, neutralized with dilute sulphuric acid, and reprecipitate
with mercuric chloride. The solutions to which mercuric
chloride had been added were allowed to stand several days. The
results may be tabulated as follows:</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">I. opaca, leaves</td>
<td class="tdl">No alkaloid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">I. opaca, berries</td>
<td class="tdl">No alkaloid.</td>

<td class="tdl">Caffeine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">I. cassine, berries</td>
<td class="tdl">No alkaloid.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>I regard these analyses as conclusive, at least, of the absence
of the known, well characterized alkaloids. It is, of course,
possible that other methods might reveal the presence of some
of the more elusive ones.</p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that of the five species
in the genus <i>Thea</i>, only one contains <i>theine</i>; of the
genus <i>Cinchonaceæ</i>, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> which coffee belongs, only one contains
<i>caffeine</i>; while of the many species of Ilex in South America,
only three, so far as known, contain caffeine. Chemists assert that
theine and caffeine are identical, but physicians know that they differ
widely in their physiological and therapeutic effects.</p>


<h3>PHYSIOLOGICAL AND TOXIC EFFECTS.</h3>

<p>All of the hollies possess decided physiological action on the human
system. <i>Ilex opaca</i> once had a large reputation in Europe and
England in rheumatism, gout, cutaneous diseases, and intermittent
fever. The young leaves and branches, in France, are fed to cattle, and
said to increase the quantity and quality of the milk of cows.</p>

<p>Griffith (Medical Botany, 1847) writes of the <i>cassine</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another native species, the <i>I. vomitoria</i>, of Aiton,
appears to be endowed with still more powerful properties. This
is a native of the most southern parts of the country, where
it is held in high esteem amongst the Indians, who considered
it a holy plant, and employed it in their religious ceremonies
and councils, to purge their bodies from all impurities.
They called both this and the <i>I. dahoon</i> by the name
of “cassena.” The leaves, which were the part employed, were
collected with great care, and formed an article of trade
among the tribes. Dr. B. S. Barton (“Collections,” 38) says of
it: “It is thought to be one of the most powerful diuretics
hitherto discovered. It is held in great esteem among the
Southern Indians; they toast the leaves and make a decoction
of them. It is the men alone that are permitted to drink this
decoction, which is called ‘black drink.’” These leaves are
inodorous, and have a somewhat aromatic, acrid taste. In small
doses the decoction acts as a powerful diuretic, and in large
ones produces discharges from the stomach, bowels, and bladder.
In North Carolina, on the seacoast, the inhabitants modify the
deleterious action of their brackish water by boiling a few
leaves of cassena with it. (The African kola nut, powdered
and added to foul water, is said to purify it. It contains
theobromine, an alkaloid analogous to caffeine.)</p>
</div>

<p>Rafinesque (Medical Botany, 1828) calls it “<i>Cassine Peragua</i>”
(Schoeph), or <i>Ilex vomitoria</i> (Aiton), and says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This by some is said to be the true cassine of the Florida
tribes. But <i>C. aumlosa</i> (Rafinesque), <i>Ilex
cassine</i>, and <i>dahoon</i>, <i>Viburnum cassinoides</i>,
are all equally so named and used. The leaves are bitterish,
sudorific, purgative, and diuretic; vomitive and purgative in
strong decoctions, called “black drink.” Said to be useful in
gravel, nephritis, diabetes, fevers, and small-pox.</p>
</div>

<p>King (Dispensatory, 1864) says: “The <i>Ilex vomitoria</i>, or ‘South
Sea tea,’ is the cassine of the Indians. A few leaves of this plant
lessen the injurious influence of saline water.”</p>

<p>It has never been made officinal in any pharmacopœia in this country or
Europe.</p>


<h3>METHOD OF PREPARATION.</h3>

<p>The leaves and young tender branches were carefully picked. The fresh
cassine was gathered at the time of harvest or maturity of the fruits,
which was their New Year. The New Year began with the “busk,” which was
celebrated in July or August, “at the beginning of the first new moon
in which their corn became full eared,” says Adair. The leaves were
dried in the sun or shade and afterwards roasted. The process seems to
have been similar to that adopted for tea and coffee. The roasting was
done in ovens, remains of which are found in the Cherokee region; or in
large shallow pots or pans of earthenware, such as the Indian tribes
made.</p>

<p>These roasted leaves were kept in baskets in a dry place until needed
for use. Laudonnière (1564) writes of being presented with baskets
filled with leaves of the cassine. A description of the method of
making the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> decoction, or “black drink,” will be found in Dickenson’s
and Bartram’s narrations, and in other quotations below. A special
feature was the practice of pouring the liquid from one bowl to another
until a deep froth appeared. Whether this was supposed to increase the
potency of the beverage, or was a fashion, like the Spanish method of
whipping chocolate to a foam, is a question; probably the latter is the
true explanation. The Japanese treat their infusions of tea in the same
manner.</p>

<p><i>Was it an article of commerce?</i>—There seems to be no doubt on
this subject. Allusions to the drinking of the “black drink” are found,
indicating its use among tribes residing at a long distance from the
habitat of the cassine.</p>

<p>Lawson (1709) writes of its being “collected by the savages of the
coast of Carolina, and from them sent to the westward Indians and sold
at a considerable price.” Dr. Porcher, author of the “Resources of
the South,” says: “The Creek Indians used a decoction of the cassine
at the opening of their councils, <i>sending to the seacoast for a
supply</i>,” and adds that the coast Indians sent it to the far west
tribes. How far its use extended northward I can not ascertain. From
some allusions of the early French writers I think it was used by
the Natchez, and that it was sent up the Mississippi from the coast
of Louisiana. The Indians of Wisconsin, Illinois, and westward, used
a decoction of willow leaves as a beverage, but I can not find that
they used it in ceremonials, or that it was looked upon with the same
reverence.</p>

<p>It appears from the accounts of various early writers that there were
several methods of preparing the black drink.</p>

<p>(1) The decoction made of the fresh leaves and young branches.</p>

<p>(2) A decoction of the dried and roasted leaves. It is probable that
the leaves during roasting developed new qualities, as the roasting of
coffee brings out the aromatic odor due to a volatile oil.</p>

<p>(3) A decoction which was allowed to ferment. In this condition
it became an alcoholic beverage, capable of causing considerable
intoxication, similar to that caused by beer or ale.</p>

<p>McCullough, in his “Researches,” seems to be in error when he asserts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>None of the people of Florida appear to have used intoxicating
drinks; but they made a hot tea from the leaves of the cassine
(<i>Prinos glaber</i>), which they poured backwards and
forwards until it frothed. This tea may have been slightly
stimulant, but it seems to have had no other than a diaphoretic
or diuretic effect.</p>
</div>

<p>This seems to have been the belief of all the early writers, but I
have always doubted it, for if true the North American Indians would
stand about alone among races above the lower grade of savagery in
their ignorance of alcoholic beverages. The Mexican Indians (Aztecs),
the tribes of the Pacific coast and of Central America, all had
intoxicating drinks. I admit that there is no proof that the Indians of
Canada and of the States north of the Ohio and the Potomac possessed
intoxicating beverages, but there is ample proof that the southern
Indians brewed from cassine a strong beer.</p>

<p>In my experiments I find that an infusion of cassine leaves with
boiling water, after standing till cool, gives a scarcely perceptible
taste and slight odor. This infusion, if boiled for half an hour,
gives a dark liquid like very strong black tea, of an aromatic odor,
<i>sui generis</i>, not like coffee, but more like Oolong tea without
its pleasant rose odor. The taste is like that of an inferior black
tea, quite bitter, but with little delicacy of flavor. It is not an
unpleasant beverage, and I can imagine that the palate would become
accustomed to it, as to maté, tea, or coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>


<h3>HISTORY.</h3>

<p>The early history of the use of <i>Ilex cassine</i> as a beverage is
lost in the darkness of prehistoric ages. Probably the same can be said
of tea, coffee, maté, and cocoa. But it is a singular fact that while
all the latter beverages still continue to be used in the countries
where they are indigenous, as well as all over the world, the use of
cassine is nearly extinct, as it is now only used occasionally in
certain important religious ceremonies by the remnants of the Creek
Indians, and will disappear with them unless rescued by chemical
research and its use revived for hygienic or economical reasons.</p>

<p>The very earliest mention of cassine was made in the “Migration Legend
of the Creek Indians.” This curious legend has been lately published
by A. S. Gatschet, of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D. C., with
text, glossaries, etc. In his preface he says: “The migration legend
of the Kosihta tribe is one of the most fascinating accounts that has
reached us from remote antiquity and is mythical in its first part.”
This tribe was a part of the Creek Nation. Its chief, Tchikilli, read
the legend before Governor Oglethorpe and many British authorities
in 1735. It was written in red and black characters (pictographic
signs) on a buffalo skin. This was sent to London, and was lost there;
but fortunately a text of the narrative was preserved in a German
translation.</p>

<p>It begins by narrating that the tribe started from a region variously
supposed to be west of the Mississippi, or in southern Illinois, or
southern Ohio. They traveled west, then south, then southeast, until
they reached eastern Georgia. Here they met a tribe, called in the
legend, the “Palachucolas,” who gave them “black drink” as a sign of
friendship, and said to them, “Our hearts are white, and yours must be
white, and you must lay down the bloody tomahawk, and show your bodies
as a proof that they shall be white.”</p>

<p>This was evidently the first knowledge the Kosihta tribe had of this
beverage.</p>

<p>The next mention is by Cabeza de Vaca, who found the Cutalchiches west
of the mouth of the Mississippi drinking a tea from the leaves of a
tree like an oak. Another narrative says, “Leaves like a plum leaf.” It
was drunk by men only.</p>

<p>Jean Ribault, the French explorer of east Florida (1666), mentions
his first experience in tasting the beverage: “Leur boisson qu’ils
appellent <i>cassinet</i> se fait d’herbes composées, et m’a semblé
de telle couleur que la cervoyce de ce pays; j’en ay gousté et ne
l’ay point trouvé fort estrange.” (Their drink, which they call
<i>cassinet</i>, is made of compounded herbs, and seemed to me about
the color of French beer. I tasted it and did not find it at all
unpleasant.)</p>

<p>Gatschet, in commenting on the mention of cassine in the legend, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Black drink was prepared from the small and narrow leaves
and the tender shoots of the shrub Ilex cassine, which grows
spontaneously as far north as the thirty-seventh degree of
latitude. The white people of the Carolinas prepared from it
a sort of tea. The botanical name formerly given to the plant
was <i>Cassine yaupon</i>, yaupon being a derivative from the
Katawba term <i>yáp</i> or <i>yop</i> plant, tree, or shrub.
The name cassine was first applied, as Prof. Lester F. Ward
informs me, as a generic name to a South African plant by
Linné, and as a species name for an Ilex by Thomas Walter.
(Dahoon is the name of another Ilex; Walter spells it duhoon,
others <i>houx d’ahon</i>.) The plant and decoction are called
by the Sketimasha, <i>nu’ut</i>; by the Creeks, Assi luputski,
<i>small leaves</i>, which is generally abbreviated to Assi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
leaves. The term black drink originated among the British
traders. In Ch. C. Jones’s “Tomochichi,” p. 118, it is called
“foskey.”</p>

<p>The Creeks made use of the Assi as we use fermented liquors, to
promote conviviality; but it entered also into their ceremonies
of religion and warfare. But the black drink potion was not
always prepared in the same strength. The ancient Creeks had
three modes of preparing it; the three potions resulting from
them widely differed in strength according to the uses for
which they were intended. Small quantities of the young leaf,
parched in a pot until it assumed a brown color, produced a
liquor acting as an exhilarant and gentle diuretic; it was
drank by the people at the busk, and by the “elders” when
assembled in council or when discussing every-day topics. After
the potion had been poured from one pan or cooler into another,
it begins to ferment and to produce a white froth, from which
it is styled also <i>white drink</i>, the term “white” alluding
simultaneously to its purifying qualities. To make the liquid
stronger a larger infusion of the parched leaves is required;
it then assumes a dark hue, nearly as black as molasses, and
acts as a powerful intoxicating stimulant. A still larger
addition of the cassine leaf produces a strong narcotic, which
was, as mentioned previously, used by conjurors to evoke
prophetic ecstacies accompanied by dreams. The black drink of
the weaker sort acts as an emetic,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and was used as such at
the annual busk and on other occasions extensively; this gave
to the liquid its renown as a bodily and moral purificator,
for primitive people are prone to regard agencies which act
with mysterious force upon the bodily constitution as symbols
for abstract spiritual or religious ideas. This drink being
served at all games and festivals, councils, and conclusions of
treaties, special ministrants, the Hinihalgi, were appointed
for its manufacture by the miko of the town. On festive days
they prepared it with peculiar ceremonies and served it to all
who attended the celebration in the square. The singing of the
yahola, or black-drink note, was, and is still, a peculiar rite
connected with the drinking of this favorite liquid.</p>
</div>

<p>Narvaez writes (1536) of the Indians on the coast of Texas:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They have a sort of drink made of the leaves of a tree like
the mulberry tree, which they boil very well and work it up
into a froth, and so drink it as hot as ever they can suffer
it to come into their mouths. All the while this is over the
fire the vessel must be close shut; and if by chance it should
be uncovered, and a woman should come by in the meantime, they
would drink none of it, but fling it all away. Likewise, while
they stand cooling it and pouring it out to drink, a woman must
not stir or move, or they would throw it all to the ground,
or spew it up again if they had drunk any; she herself would
incur the bastinado. All this time they continue bawling out
aloud, “Who will drink?” and when the women begin to hear these
exclamations, then it is that they settle themselves in their
postures, and were they sitting or standing, though it were a
tiptoe, or one leg up and the other down, they must continue so
till the men have cooled their liquor and made it fit to drink.
The reason of this is every whit as foolish and unreasonable
as the custom itself, for they say should not the women stand
still when they hear their voice some bad thing would be
conveyed into the liquor, which they say would make them die;
and if such a generation of asses were all poisoned it were no
great loss to the world.</p>
</div>

<p>In the narrative of René Laudonnière (1564) he says of his expedition
from Fort Caroline, at the mouth of the river of May (St. Johns),
Florida:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I departed with fifty of my best soldiers in two barks, and
arrived in the dominion of Utina, distant from our fort about
40 or 50 leagues (125 miles); and going ashore we drew near his
village, situated 6 leagues from the river, where we took him
prisoner. They (his tribe) therefore brought me fish in their
little boats, and their meal of mast (maize); they also made
their drink which they call cassine, which they sent to Utina
and me.</p>
</div>

<p>The map in Le Moine’s Narrative shows the residence of Utina to be west
of the river St. Johns, and in such a position that it is possible that
Laudonnière went up the St. Johns to the Ochlawaha River, then up that
river to Orange Creek and to Orange Lake, which is of crescent shape,
just as it is figured on Le Moine’s map. The cassine which Utina’s
men sent to him must have been obtained from the east or west coast,
unless it was the leaves of the <i>Ilex dahoon</i>, which grows in the
interior of Florida.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Le Moine, in his “Narrative,” illustrated with drawings and written in
1504, has the following mention of cassine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I sent a second expedition, with two shallops, having soldiers
and sailors aboard, with a present to be given in my name to
the widow of a deceased chief named Hionacara, who lived about
12 miles north of us. She received my men kindly, and loaded
both of these shallops, for me, with maize and nuts; and she
sent in addition some baskets of cassina leaves, of which they
make a drink.</p>
</div>

<p>In another place he describes the proceedings of the original
Floridians in deliberating on important affairs; this description is
illustrated with a spirited drawing:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chief and his nobles are accustomed during certain days of
the year to meet early every morning for this express purpose
in a public place, in which a long bench is constructed, having
at the middle of it a projecting part laid with nine round
trunks of trees, for the chief’s seat. On this he sits by
himself for distinction sake; and the rest come to salute him,
one at a time, the oldest first, by lifting both hands twice
to the height of the head, and saying, “Ha, he, ya, ha, ha.”
To this the rest answer, “Ha, ha.” Each as he completes his
salutation, takes his seat on the bench. If any question of
importance is to be discussed the chief calls upon his lauas
(that is, his priests), and upon the elders, one at a time, to
deliver their opinions. They decide upon nothing until they
have held a number of councils over it, and they deliberate
very sagely before deciding. Meanwhile the chief orders the
women to boil some cassine; which is a drink prepared from
the leaves from a certain root and which they afterwards pass
through a strainer.</p>

<p>The chief and his councillors being now seated in their places,
one stands before him, and spreading forth his hands wide
open, asks a blessing upon the chief and the others who are to
drink. Then the cup-bearer brings the hot drink in a capacious
shell, first to the chief, and then, as the chief directs, to
the rest in their order, in the same shell. They esteem this
drink so highly that no one is allowed to drink it in council
unless he has proved himself a brave warrior. Moreover, this
drink has the quality of at once throwing into a sweat whoever
drinks it. On this account those who can not keep it down, but
whose stomachs reject it, are not intrusted with any difficult
commission, or any military responsibility, being considered
unfit, for they often have to go three or four days without
food; but one who can drink this liquor can go for 24 hours
afterward without eating or drinking. In military expeditions
also, the only supplies which they carry consist of gourd
bottles or wooden vessels full of this drink. It strengthens
and nourishes the body, and yet does not fly to the head, as we
have observed on occasion of these feasts of theirs.</p>
</div>

<p>In “The Karankawa Indians, the coast people of Texas,” by A. S.
Gatschet (Peabody Museum, 1891), Mrs. Oliver, who lived among that
tribe, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At their principal festival, at the full moon, they assembled
in a tent, in the middle of which was a small fire upon which
boiled a very strong and black decoction made from the leaves
of the youpon tree. From time to time this was stirred with
a whisk, till the top was covered thickly with a yellowish
froth. This tea, contained in a vessel of clay of their own
manufacture, was handed around occasionally and all the Indians
drank freely. It was very bitter and said to be intoxicating,
but if so, it could only have been when drunk to great excess,
as it never seemed to produce any visible effect upon them.</p>
</div>

<p>She further mentions a chant, which rose and fell in a melancholy
cadence, and occasionally all the Indians joined in the chorus, which
was ha-i-yah, ha-i-yah, hai, hai-yah, hai-yah. The first two words were
shouted slowly, then a succession of hai-yahs very rapidly uttered in
chromatic ascending and descending tones, ending in an abrupt hai! very
loud and far reaching. [Compare this with the Creek ceremonies—Adair.]</p>

<p>Gatschet adds a note: “The Texans find it [yopon] in the woods, not on
the coast line, and drink a tea or decoction of it with sugar and milk.
The white people east of the Mississippi do the same.”</p>

<p>In the narrative of the expedition of Dominique de Gourges (1567) to
Florida, to revenge the massacre of the Huguenots at St. Augustine, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
is narrated that when he was on a visit to the Chief Satoriona, whose
tribe lived in southern Georgia, near the seacoast—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Before leaving there the savages made a beverage, called by
them <i>cassine</i>, which they are accustomed to take at all
times, and when they go to fight in places where there is
danger. This beverage, made of a certain plant, and drunk quite
hot, keeps them from being hungry or thirsty for 24 hours. They
presented it first to Captain Gourges, who pretended to drink
it, and swallowed none of it; then Satoriona partook of it, and
after him all the others, each one according to his rank.</p>
</div>

<p>This assertion that the drink prevents hunger and thirst reminds us of
the similar effect of coca leaves used by the Peruvian Indians, and now
an officinal medicine used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>James Adair was an Englishman, who lived 40 years among the Southern
Indians (from 1735 to 1775), and whose “History of the American
Indians” is invaluable to the antiquarian. It was published in London,
A. D. 1775, and is a mine of valuable information. He thus describes
the cassine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a species of tea that grows spontaneously and in
great plenty along the seacoast of the two Carolinas, Georgia,
and east and west Florida, which we call <i>yopon</i> or
<i>casseena</i>. The Indians transplant and are very fond
of it. They drink it on certain occasions, and in the most
religious ceremonies, with awful invocations; but the women and
children and those who have not accompanied their holy ark,
<i>pro aris et focis</i>, dare not even enter the sacred square
when they are on their religious duty.</p>
</div>

<p>He says distinctly that the Indians “transplant” the shrub, which means
that they cultivated it, and in another place he uses a phrase which
implies that they had plantations near to their “temples,” or places
of worship. Travelers in Paraguay assert that, though attempts have
been made by Jesuits and others to cultivate plantations of maté, or
Paraguay tea, it has never succeeded under cultivation. Adair is the
only author who mentions this transplanting.</p>

<p>In another place Adair says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The yopon, or casseena, is very plenty [in northwest Florida]
as far as the salt air reaches over the lowlands. It is well
tasted and very agreeable to those who accustom themselves
to use it. Instead of having any noxious quality, according
to what many have experienced of the East India insipid and
costly tea, it is friendly to the human system, enters into and
contests with the peccant humors, and expels them through the
various channels of nature. It perfectly cures a tremor of the
nerves.</p>
</div>

<p>At the time Adair wrote the above, Chinese tea was a rare and expensive
luxury in England, and its use was opposed as intensely as was the use
of tobacco when it was first introduced. The power ascribed to cassine
of curing “tremors” is significant. Adair, in the same paragraph,
mentions another leaf used as a beverage, but his description is so
indefinite that I am not able to decide as to its botanical name. It
is certainly not the <i>Ceanothus</i> (New Jersey tea). On referring
to Rafinesque, I think this “North America tea” may be the <i>Viburnum
cassinoides</i>, which, he says, is “also named cassine, and so used.”
He also says that “<i>V. levigatum</i> and <i>V. prunifolium</i> are
used for the tea in the South.”</p>

<p>Adair further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The North American tea has a pleasant aromatic taste and the
same salubrious property as the casseena. It is an evergreen
and grows on hills. The bushes are about a foot high, each
of them containing in winter a small, aromatic, red berry in
the middle of the stalk. Such I saw it about Christmas, when
hunting among the mountains, opposite to the lower Mohawk
Castle, in the time of deep snow. There is no visible decay of
the leaf, and October seems the proper time to gather it.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>He frequently refers to the “sacred uses” of the <i>black drink</i>, a
decoction of the cassine. I quote his most important allusions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a carved human statue of wood, to which, however,
they pay no religious homage. It belongs to the head war
town of the upper Muskogee country, and seems to have
been originally designed to perpetuate the memory of some
distinguished hero who deserved well of his country, for when
this <i>casseena</i>, or bitter black drink, is about to be
drank in the Synedrion they frequently on common occasions will
bring it there and honor it with the first conch shell full, by
the hand of the chief religious attendant, and then they return
it to its former place. It is observable that the same beloved
waiter, or holy attendant, and his coadjutant, equally observe
the same ceremony to every person of reputed merit of that
quadrangular place.</p>
</div>

<p>(Adair seems to have written this book for the sole purpose of proving
that the Creeks were one of the lost tribes of Israel. He imagines that
in one of their religious festivals they invoke the name of Jehovah
under the appellation of Y-O-He-Wah.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When this beloved liquid, or supposed drink offering, is fully
prepared and fit to be drank, one of the magi brings two old,
consecrated, large conch shells out of a place appropriate for
containing the holy things, and delivers them into the hands of
two religious attendants, who, after a wild ceremony, fill them
with the supposed sanctifying bitter liquid; then they approach
near to the two central red and white seats (which the leaders
call the war and beloved cabins), stooping with their heads
and bodies pretty low. Advancing a few steps in this posture,
they carry their shells with both hands, at an instant, to
one of the most principal men on those red and white seats,
saying in a bass key, Yah, quite short; then in like manner
they retreat backwards, facing each other with their heads
bowing forward, their arms across rather below their breasts
and their eyes half shut. Thus in a very grave, solemn manner
they sing on a strong bass key the awful monosyllable O for
the space of a minute; then they strike up a majestic He on
the treble, with a very intent voice, as long as their breath
allows them, and on a bass key, with a bold voice and short
accent, they at last utter the strong, mysterious accent Wah,
and thus finish the great song, or most solemn invocation of
the divine essence. The notes together compose the sacred,
mysterious name, Y-O-He-Wah. The favored persons, whom the
religious attendants are invoking the divine essence to bless,
hold up their shells with both hands to their mouths during the
awful sacred invocation, and retain a mouthful of the drink to
spurt out upon the ground as a supposed drink offering to the
great self-existing giver, which they offer at the end of their
draft. If any of the traders who at those times are invited
to drink with them were to neglect this religious observance
they would reckon us as godless and wild as the wolves of
the desert. After the same manner the supposed holy waiters
proceed, from the highest to the lowest, in their Synedrion,
and when they have ended that awful solemnity they go round the
whole square, or quadrangular place, and collect tobacco from
the sanctified sinners, according to ancient customs: “For they
who serve at the altar must live by the altar.”</p>
</div>

<p>In another place (page 106), in describing at great length one of the
religious festivals of the Creeks, Adair says: “He” [the Arch Magus, or
fire-maker,] “consecrates the button-snake root and casseena by pouring
a little of those two strong decoctions into the pretended holy fire.
He then purifies the red and white seats with those bitter liquids and
sits down.”</p>

<p>This leads me to observe that the sacred “black drink” was not made of
the cassine alone, but sometimes of several bitter and aromatic roots
and leaves. Mrs. A. E. W. Robertson, in a letter from Okmulgee, Ind.
T., writes: “The black drink as now prepared is, I think, made from
three plants, the “Passa,” (Pasa) or Button Snakeroot (<i>Eryngium
aquaticum</i>), and the Mekko Hoyonee v. (<i>Micco-Hoyonvicha</i>),
a small willow, and the third I do not now recall.” It may be that
cassine is not now used at all by the Creeks in Indian Territory, for
it does not grow there, and if used would have to be imported from the
Atlantic or Gulf coast.</p>

<p>Bossu, who traveled through the country now known as Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, in 1751, makes no mention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
use of cassine by the Indians of the two first-named States (Natchez),
nor by the Indians along the Mississippi as far as he traveled, namely,
to the country of the Illinois. But in his travels eastward, when he
was in the neighborhood of Mobile, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All the Allibamas drink the cassine.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> This is the leaf of
a little tree which is very shady; the leaf is about the
size of a farthing, but dentated on its margins. They toast
these leaves as we do coffee, and drink the infusion of them
with great ceremony. When this diuretic potion is prepared,
the young people go to present it, in calabashes formed into
cups, to the chiefs and warriors, that is, the honorables,
and afterwards to the other warriors, according to their rank
and degree. The same order is preserved when they present the
calumet to smoke out of. Whilst you drink, they howl as loud as
they can and diminish the sound gradually. When you have ceased
drinking they take their breath, and when you drink again they
set up their howls again. These sorts of orgies sometimes
last from 6 in the morning to 2 o’clock in the afternoon. The
Indians find no inconvenience from this potion, to which they
attribute many virtues, and return it without any effort. The
women never drink of this beverage, which is only made for the
warriors.</p>
</div>

<p>What Bossu says relating to the size of the leaves shows conclusively
that it was the leaf of the tree <i>Ilex cassine</i>, for one of the
leaves is just the diameter of the English farthing, a coin the size
of the old half cent of American currency. His phrase “return it
without any effort” is rather ambiguous, but it probably refers to the
expulsion of the decoction after having drenched their stomachs with
it. I do not think this was a true emesis, for there is no proof that
it was an emetic. The Indians doubtless swallowed such large quantities
that it was regurgitated without effort.</p>

<p>Bossu’s only other reference to the cassine is when, in describing a
council between the French and the Allibamas, he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Chevalier de Emville held a speech to the assembly in his
turn, and made the nation a present which the governor had sent
him. The Indians gave him the great calumet of peace to smoke;
all the soldiers and French inhabitants likewise smoked it, in
sign of a general amnesty. Afterwards they drank the cassine,
which is the potion of the white word, <i>i. e.</i>, the potion
of oblivion and peace.</p>
</div>

<p>Bernard Romans, “Natural History of Florida” (1775), page 94, writes as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>cassine</i> is used by them (the Creeks) as a drink;
they barbecue or toast the leaves and make a strong decoction
of them; then men only are permitted to drink this liquor, to
which they attribute many virtues. It is made so strong as to
be <i>black</i> and raise a froth. When they drink it at their
assemblies in the square they call it black drink.</p>
</div>

<p>Romans states (p. 96) that it was the business of the women to “prepare
the cassine drink.” These are his only allusions to cassine.</p>

<p>William Bartram, in his “Travels in Florida” (1792), one of the
most fascinating books ever written, narrates that he attended a
“feast” given by the “White king of Talahafochta,” near the River
“Appalochuchla” (Apalachicola), and says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the feast was over, * * * our chief, with the rest of the
white people in town, took their seats according to order;
tobacco and pipes were brought; the calumet was lighted and
smoked, circulating according to the usual forms and ceremony;
and afterwards <i>black drink</i> concluded the feast. The king
conversed, drank <i>cassine</i>, and associated familiarly with
his people and with us. (P. 234.)</p>
</div>

<p>Again, when in what is now Georgia, or extreme north Florida, meeting
the Creek Indians at a town he calls “Attasse,” he attended a great
council of the chiefs of that nation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was introduced to the ancient chiefs at the public square
or areopagus; and in the evening in company with the traders,
who are numerous in this town, repaired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> to the great rotunda,
where were assembled the greatest number of ancient, venerable
chiefs and warriors that I had ever beheld; we spent the
evening and greater part of the night together in drinking
cassine and smoking tobacco. The great council house, or
rotunda, is appropriated to much the same purpose as the public
square, but more private, and seems particularly dedicated to
political affairs; women and youth are never admitted, and I
suppose it is death for a female to presume to enter the door
or approach within its pale. It is a vast conical building of
circular dome, capable of accommodating many hundred people:
constructed and furnished within exactly in the same manner as
those of the Cherokees already described, but much larger than
any I had seen of them; there are people appointed to take care
of it, to have it daily swept clean, and to provide canes for
fuel or to give light. As their vigils and manner of conducting
their vespers and mystical fire in this rotunda are extremely
singular, and altogether different from the customs and usages
of any other people, I shall proceed to describe them. In the
first place, the governor or officer who has the management of
this business, with his servants attending, orders the black
drink to be brewed, which is a decoction or infusion of the
leaves and tender shoots of the <i>cassine</i>; this is done
under an open shed or pavilion, at 20 or 30 yards distance,
directly opposite the door of the council house. Next he orders
bundles of dry canes to be brought in; these are previously
split and broken in pieces to about the length of 2 feet, and
then placed obliquely crossways upon one another on the floor,
forming a spiral circle round about the great center pillar,
rising to a foot or 18 inches in height from the ground; and
this circle, spreading as it proceeds round and round, often
repeated from right to left, every revolution increases its
diameter, and it at length extends to the distance of 10 or 12
feet from the center, more or less, according to the length of
time the assembly or meeting is to continue. By the time these
preparations are accomplished, it is night, and the assembly
have taken their seats in order. The exterior extremity or
outer end of the spiral circle takes fire and immediately rises
into a bright flame (but how this is effected I did not plainly
apprehend; I saw no person set fire to it; there might have
been fire left on the earth; however, I neither saw nor smelt
fire or smoke until the blaze instantly ascended upwards),
which gradually and slowly creeps round the center pillar, with
the course of the fire, feeding on the dry canes, and affords
a cheerful, gentle, and sufficient light until the circle is
consumed, when the council breaks up.</p>

<p>Soon after this illumination takes place the aged chiefs and
warriors are seated on their cabins or sofas, on the side
of the house opposite the door, in three classes or ranks,
rising a little one above or behind the other; and the white
people and red people of confederate towns in like order on
the left hand, a transverse range of pillars, supporting a
thin clay wall about breast high, separating them; the king’s
cabin or seat is in front; the next to the back of it the
head warriors’, and the third or last accommodates the young
warriors, etc.</p>

<p>The great war chief’s seat or place is in the same cabin with
and immediately to the left hand of the king and next to the
white people; and to the right hand of the mico or king the
most venerable headmen and warriors are seated. The assembly
being now seated in order, and the house illuminated, two
middle-aged men, who perform the office of slaves or servants
<i>pro tempore</i>, come in together at the door, each having
very large conch shells full of black drink, and advance with
slow, uniform, and steady steps, their eyes or countenance
lifted up, singing very low but sweetly; they come within 6
or 8 paces of the king’s and white people’s cabin, when they
stop together, and each rests his shell on a tripod or little
table, but presently takes it up again, and bowing very low,
advances obsequiously, crossing or intersecting each other
about midway; he who rested his shell before the white people
now stands before the king, and the other, who stopped before
the king, stands before the white people, when each presents
his shell, one to the king and the other to the chief of the
white people; and as soon as he raises it to his mouth, the
slave utters or sings two notes, each of which continues as
long as he has breath, and as long as these notes continue
so long must the person drink, or at least keep the shell to
his mouth. These two long notes are very solemn, and at once
strike the imagination with a religious awe or homage to the
Supreme, sounding somewhat like a hoo-ojah and a he-yah. After
this manner the whole assembly are treated as long as the drink
or light continues to hold out; and as soon as the drinking
begins, tobacco and pipes are brought.</p>
</div>

<p>Mark Catesby (<i>Hortus americanus</i>, 1763) describes the <i>Ilex
cassine</i> as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This shrub usually rises from the ground with several stems to
the height of 12 feet, shooting into many upright, slender,
stiff branches, covered with a whitish, smooth bark, and set
alternately with small evergreen serrated leaves, resembling
those of the Aleternus; its flowers are small and white, and
grow promiscuously among the leaves, and are succeeded by small
spherical berries on short footstalks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> These berries turn red
in October and remain so all winter, whereby with the green
leaves and white bark they produce an elegant appearance.</p>

<p>But the esteem the American Indians have for this shrub,
from the great use they make of it, renders it most worthy
of notice. They say its virtues have been known amongst them
from the earliest times, and they have long used it in the
same manner as they do at present. They prepare the leaves for
keeping by drying or rather parching them in a pottage pot over
a slow fire, and a strong decoction of the leaves thus cured
is their beloved liquor, of which they drink large quantities,
both for health and pleasure, without sugar or other mixture.
They drink it down and disgorge it with ease, repeating it very
often, and swallowing many quarts. They say it restores lost
appetite, strengthens the stomach, and confirms their health,
giving them agility and courage in war. It grows chiefly in the
maritime parts of the country, but not farther north than the
capes of Virginia.</p>

<p>The Indians on the seacoast supply those of the mountains
therewith, and carry on a considerable trade with it in
Florida, just as the Spaniards do with their South Sea tea
from Paraguay to Buenos Ayres. Now, Florida being in the same
latitude north as Paraguay is south, and no apparent difference
being found on comparing the leaves of these two plants
together, it is not improbable they may be both the same.</p>

<p>In South Carolina it is called cassena, in Virginia and North
Carolina it is known by the name of yopon; in the latter of
which places it is as much in use amongst the white people as
among the Indians, and especially among those who inhabit the
seacoast.</p>

<p>This plant is raised from the seeds, which lie 2 years in the
ground before it appears; it grows plentifully on many of the
sand banks on the seashore of Carolina.</p>
</div>

<p>In that rare and quaint narrative of Jonathan Dickenson (1790), “who
was shipwrecked on the southeast coast of Florida among the savage
cannibals,” he states that when a short distance south of the “village
of Sta. Lucca” (St. Lucia), and among the Indians and at the “house
of the Cassekey,” he heard often a strange noise in another part of
the house which he could not account for. The following quotation is
interesting; it shows that cassine grows on the extreme south coast of
Florida, and gives the method of preparing the black drink among those
barbarous nations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In one part of this house where the fire was kept was an Indian
man having a pot on the fire wherein he was making a drink of
the leaves of a shrub (which we understood afterward by the
Spaniard is called cassena), boiling the said leaves after they
had parched them in a pot; then with a gourd having a long neck
and at the top of it a small hole which the top of one’s finger
could cover and at the side of it a round hole of 2 inches
diameter, they take the liquor out of the pot and put it in a
deep round bowl, which being almost filled containeth nigh 3
gallons. With this gourd they brew the liquor and make it froth
very much; it looketh of a deep brown color. In the brewing of
this liquor was this noise made which we thought strange, for
the pressing of the gourd gently down into the liquor and the
air which it contained being forced out of the little hole at
top occasioned a sound, and according to the time and motion
given would be various, this drink, when made and cooled to
sup, was in a shell first carried to the Cassekey, who threw
part of it on the ground and the rest he drank up, and then
would make a loud <i>hem</i>, and afterwards the cup passed
to the rest of the Cassekey’s associates as aforesaid, but no
other man, woman, or child must touch or taste of this sort
of drink, of which they sat sipping, chattering, and smoking
tobacco, or some other herb instead thereof, for the most part
of the day.</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter from William Baldwin, a noted naturalist and surgeon in the
U. S. Navy, written from St. Marys, Fla. (6 miles from Fernandina), in
1816, he mentions finding the <i>Ilex prinoides</i> predominant on the
sandy, shrubby plains of the vicinity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Its common height is about 6 or 8 feet, and at this season
(December), with its ripe crimson-colored fruit, makes a fine
appearance. The berry of this species is considerably larger
than that of any other I have seen, and is not unpleasant to
the taste, possessing an agreeable sweet, along with a slight
bitter. I have eaten freely of it with entire impunity.</p>
</div>

<p>He discusses the question whether the genus Prinos should not be merged
into that of Ilex. They are so near alike that their leaves doubtless
possess similar properties, and are probably mixed with cassine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Collinson, in a letter from London, England, to John Bartram, 1739,
makes mention of “the yupon of Virginia, or cassena of Carolina”
(<i>Ilex cassena</i> or <i>I. vomituria</i>). The Indians drive a great
trade with the berries (?) to make tea with to the Gulf of Mexico. It
grows nowhere to the northward of that island they found it on, which
belongs to Col. Custis. I have it in my garden. (He errs as to the
berries being used, but proves that it can be cultivated.)</p>

<p>Dr. Fothergill cultivated it together with maté in his botanical garden
in London in 1784. (See his Memoirs.)</p>

<p>John Lee Williams, in his history of east and west Florida, 1837, a
work unique in character and of special value to historians, contains
but one mention of the “black drink.” It is in a mention of Oseola, a
noted chief of the Seminoles. In writing of his parentage, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Powell, or Oseola, is a native Red Stick; who his father was
is unknown, but it is said that his mother was at one time
connected with an Englishman of the name of Powell. We are
informed by a respectable Creek chief that his name is As-sin
Yahole, “Singer at the black drink.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now this word As-sin is a variation of cassine, and Oseola was probably
one of those whose duty it was to sing during the ceremonies which
accompanied the drinking of cassine.</p>

<p>It is strange that the cassine has not been celebrated in poetry or
song. The songs of the Creeks have not been preserved. Perhaps they
sung the praises of the “black drink.” The only mention I find in
poetry is an allusion to it as “the tough cassine,” in the poems of
Mrs. Sigourney, when she enumerates the variety and qualities of the
trees of America.</p>

<p>C. C. Jones, in his “Antiquities of the Southern Indians,” writes (page
11): “The black drink was a decoction of the leaves and tender twigs
of the cassine, or Ilex yupon.” He mentions no other ingredients, but
other observers claim that the <i>Iris versicolor</i> (blue flag) and
sometimes the <i>Lobelia inflata</i> were used. My opinion is that,
when used in their wars or religious festivals, other ingredients were
used, for it is represented as powerfully purgative and emetic. Yet, on
the other hand, we are told that the two species of <i>Ilex cassine</i>
and <i>dahoon</i> possess these qualities. The <i>I. cassine</i> is
called by some botanists <i>Ilex vomitoria</i>. On social occasions the
black drink was probably made of the leaves of the cassine alone, or
made much weaker. Jones writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Mico councillors or warriors meet every day in the public
square, sit and drink acee (assi), a strong decoction of the
cassine yupon, called by traders black drink, talk of the news,
the public and domestic concerns, etc. They have a regular
ceremony for making as well as delivering the acee to all who
attend the square.</p>
</div>

<p>The black drink made by the Seminoles is described as “nauseous to the
smell and taste, and emetic and purgative.” It is a mixture and not
brewed of the cassine alone. All our beverages, such as tea, coffee,
maté, and even chocolate, when drank very strong are capable of causing
diuresis, purging, and vomiting.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of the drinking of the black drink is that, so far as I
can ascertain, it was not used at their meals as we use tea and coffee,
but wholly as a social beverage or at festivals and other public
occasions. I do not think the women were allowed to drink it, at least
not publicly. Authorities differ on this point.</p>

<p>Among the Creeks the women sometimes prepared the black drink, but
Narvaez writes that the Indians on the coast of what is now Texas did
not allow a woman to come near it during its preparation.</p>

<p>That a beverage containing caffeine should fall into disuse and become
almost forgotten is a singular fact. The use of maté has not decreased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
from the time of the conquest of South America by Europeans. The reason
why the latter is still in use and the former not lies, perhaps, in
the fact that the Europeans in South America mixed with the natives,
married, and adopted their customs, while the English and French
who settled the Gulf States did not associate with the Indians, and
adhered to the use of Chinese tea. Now that we know that the leaf of
the cassine contains caffeine or theine, can its use as a beverage be
revived?</p>

<p>It is not as pleasant in odor and taste as <i>Thea sinensis</i>, and
this may be against it; on the other hand, it seems to have some
salutary properties which the latter does not possess, and may,
perhaps, be far more cheaply obtained.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption">Distribution of the <i>Ilex cassine</i>, indicated by
dotted portions along coast line.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A rough estimate can be made as to the number of square miles upon
which it grows. Estimating the coast line from the James River,
in Virginia, to the Rio Grande, in Texas—about 2,000 miles—and
multiplying this by 20 miles, the extent of its growth inland, we get
a total of about 40,000 square miles. On this area could be picked an
immense quantity of the leaves, and if the trees are not destroyed in
the picking the crops could be harvested every year. No estimate can be
approximated even of the amount of the crop of leaves which could be
gathered, because we can not estimate the number of trees on this area.</p>

<p>It would seem possible that further inquiries on this point and careful
experiments in cultivation and manipulation might result in furnishing
our market with a product which would be found in many cases an
acceptable and useful substitute for the more expensive imported teas.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
